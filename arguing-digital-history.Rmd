<!--
1. How is argumentation different? How is it the same?
- differences
  - computational
  - visual
  - scale of sources
- similarity
  - thesis built on evidence
  - recognizes context
  
2. Should DH argumentation be inherently discplinary or interdisciplinary?
- hard to identify areas of history that aren't *more* interdisciplinary

3. Why are there not more projects that make explicit arguments? What barriers exist?
- narrative

4. What models exist for making explicit arguments? What's the relationship between traditional venues for publication?
- Valley of the Shadow
- America's Public Bible

5. How have you used digital history to make explicit arguments in conversation w/ scholarly literature?

First, perhaps, a loose definition of "digital history": I take digital history to mean a variety of approaches to using computational, visual, and informational methods in analyzing, visualizing, and presenting historical analysis and arguments. As I consider the ways that "digital history" can engage with argumentation, then, I assume particularities of digital history that rely on graphical displays (maps, networks), take advantage of narrative and hypertextuality, provide access to digitized primary sources, share historical evidence and data compiled for computation and visualization, and that takes the form of a digital scholarly website that integrates some or all of these aspects of research and communication. Such projects are distinct from efforts that define themselves as public history; while much of digital history can be said to be public scholarship, that does not mean they rise to the criteria of public history.^[Jason Heppler, et al., "Public History as Digital History as Public History," working group, National Council on Public History Annual Meeting, Nashville, Tennessee, April 2015.] Under this definition, it may be obvious, but digital history must be explicitly *digital*: that the arguments, visualizations, and narrative are much harder to achieve in print and, thus, can only exist as a digital publication.

Many digital history projects tend to fall into the realms of digital collections or data visualization. Some of these projects have led to more traditional venues of historical writing and publishing. The *Valley of the Shadow*, an archive of Civil War-era material detailing the experiences of Confederate and Union soldiers in Augusta and Franklin Counties in Virginia, led to the publication of "The Differences Slavery Made" by Ed Ayers and William G. Thomas, as well as Ayers' *In the Presence of Mine Enemies: war in the Heart of America, 1859--1863*. The appearance of digital history projects alongside print continues: Richard White's *Railroaded* was accompanied by a digital component^[Richard White, *Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America* (New York: Norton, 2012). White's digital companion, *Railroaded*, is found at <http://railroaded.stanford.edu>.]; William G. Thomas's *The Iron Way* likewise had a digital component, providing access to primary sources, data, and visualizations^[William G. Thomas, *The Iron Way: Railroads, the Civil War, and the Making of Modern America* (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2011). Thomas's digital companion, *Railroads and the Making of Modern America*, is at <http://railroads.unl.edu/>.]; Karl Jacoby's *Shadows at Dawn* relies on a digital companion to provide access to primary sources.^[Karl Jacoby, *Shadows at Dawn: An Apache Massacre and the Violence of History* (New York: Penguin Books, 2009). Jacoby's digital companion, *Shadows at Dawn*, is at <http://brown.edu/Research/Aravaipa/>.] Conspicuously, these digital components don't exist primarily for driving a historical thesis, nor do they offer much in the way of expanding on narrative elements of their print partners (or experiments in nonlinear hypertextual narrative). They instead hinge on providing access to a set of material used by the writers in the creation of their monographs.^[The same can be said for scholarly articles. Some digital projects provide digital-only whitepapers or pre-prints, such as Stanford's Spatial History Project <http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub_toc.php>. Yet other digital projects stand on their own, but are frequently accompanied by print publications. See, for example, the work of Claire Arcenas and Caroline Winterer, *The Correspondence Network of Benjamin Franklin: The London Decades* <http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/publications/franklin/>.]

Few digital history projects have attempted to exist as digital-only publications, a situation that likely reflects the promotion and tenure realities of the academy. Few history departments have attempted to devise promotion structures and guidelines that accommodate digital scholarship, instead continuing to value print (and a book, in particular) as the cornerstone of scholarly merit.^[This is not to suggest there are no digital projects that attempt to be digital-only, but few of those have even been peer reviewed let alone granted the imprimatur of an academic press. For example, see Douglas Seefeldt, *Horrible Massacre of Emigrants!! The Mountain Meadows Massacre in Public Discourse* <http://mountainmeadows.unl.edu/>; Nick Bauch, *Enchanting the Desert* <http://enchantingthedesert.com/>; Michelle Delaney and Rebecca Wingo, *"I Shall Be Glad To See Them": Gertrude KÃ¤sebier's "Show Indian" Photographs* <http://codystudies.org/kasebier/index.html>.]
